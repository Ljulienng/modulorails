Description:
    Generates a new Modulorails service. Pass the service name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of parameters as arguments.

    To create a service within a module, specify the service name as a
    path like 'parent_module/service_name'.

    This generates a service class in app/services.

Example:
    `bin/rails generate modulorails:service Missions::Search word page per`

    Mission::Search service with positional parameters word, page and per.
        Service: app/services/missions/search_service.rb
